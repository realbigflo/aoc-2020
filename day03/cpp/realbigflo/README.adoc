Day 3: Report 
== C++

- Source was compiled with clang
- used clang-format and clang-tidy

=== Today I learned
- Not too much ... 
- Unique_ptr are sometimes ugly but very nice when you want to control the scope
- Probably the code can be even cleaner when using maps for the star2 input - but I was lazy today
