Day 1: Report 
== C++

- Source was compiled with clang
- used clang-format and clang-tidy
- Solution is for both stars straight forward using nested loops
- For the first star I used iterators while for the second star I used pure for-loops to get a better
feeling what lokks nicer and cleaner

=== Today I learned
- to love clang-tidy again
- the default of clang-tidy is not optimal for all users (and not compliant to MISRA-C++ ;-) )
- iterators are fine but unhandy when not starting at the end or begin of a container
